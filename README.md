# cloud-computing-project

Cloud computing project 1 is to implement data analytic workload using basic features
of MapReduce and Spark framework. The data set is the Trending Youtube Video
Statistics data from Kaggle. The first analysis is to find out video category and Trending
correlation among different countries. The second analysis is to see whether a video on
trending list would impact view number or not. 


Cloud computing project 2 is about spark machine learning application which includes
three stages. All stages use the MNIST data set of hand-written digits. The first stage is
to develop a KNN classifier ( there is a PCA step before it). The second stage is to
analysis the performance by adjusting the reduced dimension d , the k nearest neighbors
and execution properties that controls the maximum parallelism, namely num-executors
and executor-cores or total-executor-cores.The performance refers to execution statistics
such as execution time and total I/O cost. The Third stage is to run two algorithms in
Spark machine learning library and compare their performance in terms of accuracy and
execution statistics.
